# Blinkit Sales Analysis Problem Statement

### Dashboard 1: Summary

To monitor and evaluate Blinkit's sales performance, I have developed a customized Sales Analysis Report. This report aims to provide comprehensive insights into key sales-related metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:**

- **Total Sales:** Tracking the overall revenue generated from all items sold and monitoring trends over time.
- **Average Sales:** Understanding the average revenue per sale to gauge per-transaction profitability.
- **Number of Items:** Counting the total number of different items sold to track inventory movement and diversity.
- **Average Rating:** Calculating the average customer rating for items sold to assess customer satisfaction.
